##Inspiration:
We can never choose what to eat for lunch! Decision fatigue. There should be an easier way.

##What it does:
Removes indecision by choosing a restaurant for your next meal. Choose your parameters by price, location, cuisine and we'll decide for you!

##How we built it:

Materialize

Yelp API

Google Maps API

Opentable API (work in progress)

Postmates API(work in progress)

JavaScript

AJAX

jQuery

HTML5

CSS3

Firebase

Google Fonts


##Challenges we ran into:
Navigating the Yelp API. Linking one AJAX response to another. Trying to work with unofficial documention from the Open Table API. Getting Materialize's parallax to work.


##Accomplishments that we’re proud of:
We came up with a good concept within our scope. We have a good handle on Materialize. Most of all, the site works!


##What we learned:
OAuth. How to read and implement API documentation. Materialize, and how it does not work with the most current jQuery. 


##What’s next for SnapSnax:
A rebanding! In our research, we found that there is actually a company called SnapSnax that create delicious banana chips in the Philippines. Integrate Open Table API and Postmates for reservation and delivery functionality.
